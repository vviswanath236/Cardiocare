# CardioCare: Predicting Heart Disease

## Overview
CardioCare is a machine learning-based web application designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on various health attributes. This project aims to provide an accurate and accessible tool for early detection and prevention of heart-related illnesses.

## Features
- **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** Collects health attributes and historical heart disease data, preprocesses and cleans the dataset.
- **Machine Learning Model Training:** Trains three separate ML models (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression) on preprocessed data.
- **Algorithm Selection:** Compares and selects the most accurate algorithm (Logistic Regression achieved 90% accuracy) for heart disease prediction.
- **Flask Application Development:** Develops a user-friendly Flask-based web application for easy interaction.
- **User Interaction:** Users can input health data via the frontend, which is then sent to the backend for prediction.
- **Prediction and Result:** The selected ML algorithm processes user input data and generates heart disease predictions, displayed to the user via the frontend.
- **Deployment and Hosting:** Hosts the Flask application on a suitable platform like Heroku or AWS, ensuring data privacy and security.
